# DH140W5
This is a repository for the final project assignment for DH140, Week 5.

## The following file discusses various topics I am potentially interested in pursuing for the final project.

### Topics I am interested in 
* Representation of gender and sexual minorities in media and the public consciousness
* The formation and propagation of political grassroots movements and how they are subject to radicalization
* The prevalence of Internet technologies and how they have changed/shaped the average person's life

### Syllabus topic
Being a programmer, I am already decently familiar with quite a few of the topics we will be covering in the class, but I am most excited for network analysis. Being someone who enjoys discrete math and a bit of graph theory, I am excited to see how we will analyze networks and produce graphs to demonstrate relationships in data.

### Potential Datasets
| Name of Dataset        | Description           | Link  |

| Is Runing Enough? Reconsidering the Conventional Wisdom about Women Candidates | This dataset has various details regarding female candidates who ran for office in the United States, and lies at an intersection of my interests regarding gender representation and political affairs. Investigating this dataset would be interesting, as I would be interested in finding if there is a common thread to the efficacy (or lack thereof) of womens' campaigns for office, and what still needs to be done to bridge the gendered gap in electoral offices. | https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CFPBRI/ER5Q7X&version=1.0 |
| Internet Advertisements Data Set | This data set from 1998 has data and metadata about web advertisements on the Internet from the 1990's. While the face of the digital advertising game has changed drastically in the past twenty years, finding a more modern dataset and comparing and contrasting how things are and how things used to be would make for a very intriguing study. Are ads more or less invasive now than they were twenty years ago, in terms of both user experience and privacy?      |   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Internet+Advertisements |
